Hand gesture Recognition system provides a means for people with disabilities to communicate with others who do not understand sign language. We want to bridge the gap between them, and gesture recognition will serve as a mediator. We intend to overcome challenges in a recognition system so that performance and efficiency are not compromised. The Hand Gesture Recognition system is formed of three modules. First being the hand detector, second module keeping track of hand movements which also detects how hand position has changed  to understand the gesture.Thirdly the Gesture recognition model which will be trained on both static and dynamic dataset ,it will accurately recognize the gesture which was made by the user and display onto the screen.The trained model can be used for real-time detection, both for static hand images and dynamic gestures recorded on a video.
